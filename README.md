# Intro-Java-Course: Hello World
This repo contains the combined work from parts 1 & 2 of the "Introduction to Java" course I took as an undergrad. My first lines of code were written in these projects! I am still building on the foundational knowledge I learned here.

## Acknowledgements


I would not have been able to complete these courses without the wisdom of my illustrious mentor, Ediel Lopez! 

Most developers come off as annoyed and over emphasize due dilligence before they entertain a question- Ediel was not at all like this! He is patient, articulate, and thorough. I have grown tremendously because of his guidance. This repo is dedicated to you, brotha!
